                            Khalilah led our team in an engaging and impactful discussion on why diversity, equity and inclusion matter to all of us. Her workshop created a safe environment for individuals to speak up and share their personal experiences. Throughout the workshop, Khalilah provided relatable and specific examples to how unconscious bias impacts our day-to-day decisions and ways we can be more aware and mitigate these biases. The workshops left attendees with concrete actions they can take to be DEI leaders within their individual roles at the firm.

                            Working with Khalilah fundamentally shifted the culture in our organization. As a young arts organization, Khalilah brought vivacity, creativity, poise, and intellect that I've rarely experienced in leadership. Her expertise does not simply check the box for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion conversations - it permeates and shifts the culture of wherever she's working at a very human level. Khalilah is highly adaptable and dynamic, confident in any conversation with any person, and comfortable managing difficult conversations while staying true to the ultimate goal. Khalilah worked with us to assess what scope of work was best for our organization, and customized a proposal to meet our needs. I am incredibly grateful for the knowledge, work ethic, and energy that Khalilah brought to our organization, and we can't wait to continue to work with her in the future. I'd highly recommend Khalilah to any business or organization, large or small. Her contribution is invaluable; she's no doubt one of the best in her field.
